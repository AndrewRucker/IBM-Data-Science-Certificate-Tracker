# Projects
Repo for created projects, mainly out of interest and to improve my skills. Aim is to make myself dangerous and competent through attempting to solve problems, at first likely quite poorly, with the intentions of later on becoming competent at problem solving. Gotta be willing to be a fool if I am to become what I aim for.  

## Current Project
# IBM Data Science Certification Progress
This is a tracker of my progress for the IBM Data Science certificate offered through coursera.
