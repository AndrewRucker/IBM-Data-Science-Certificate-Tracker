# Projects
Repo for created projects, mainly out of interest and to improve my skills. Aim is to make myself dangerous and competent through attempting to solve problems, at first likely quite poorly, with the intentions of later on becoming more competent at problem solving. Gotta be willing to be a fool if I am to become what I aim for.
